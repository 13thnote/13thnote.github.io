Welcome to The 13th Note Cafe, an independent bar, restaurant and venue in Glasgow’s Merchant City. We cater for a vegan diet—all of our food is ethically sourced and free from animal cruelty—and stock a fine selection of vegan beers, lagers and wines.

We are open from midday until midnight, seven days a week. Children are welcome in our cafe, when eating, until 8pm. However, all of our gigs are over 18s only.

For cafe enquiries and table bookings, please pop by or telephone 0141 553 1638.
