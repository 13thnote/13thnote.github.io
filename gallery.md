Our exhibition space in the restaurant is free for artists to use for monthly exhibitions.

We also have a window space on King Street available for installations. Check out 24 Hour Window on Instagram.

If you are interested in exhibiting with us, please send copies of your work or a link to your website to office@13thnote.co.uk

Please note you will only be selected if the work is suitable for the cafe gallery.

All work must be framed or on canvas. Artists must also put on an opening evening. The full agreement will be sent out upon approval and dates booked.

### Information for Exhibitors

All artists exhibiting have their details listed both in our monthly printed flyer booklet and also online. So please make sure you let us know information about your exhibition, any web links, title of exhibition and artistic genre.
